Grapefruit


Cultivation
Grapefruit trees thrive in subtropical climates that have some humidity and remain consistently warm throughout the year. They grow best in full sun and well-draining, loamy soil. Grapefruit trees need to be watered every day after planting for a couple of weeks. Once more mature, they can be deeply watered once a week. It is important to keep the soil moist at all times and to keep the soil fairly warm. In colder weather, the base of the tree can be wrapped in a tarp or blanket to help keep the soil warm. Grapefruit trees can be planted in the fall or spring based on the climate and take between 3-7 years to bear fruit, depending on if it was planted from seed or a young tree. Grapefruits are typically harvested year-round with peak season in the fall and winter as each region has different fruit maturity times ranging between 7-13 months.
