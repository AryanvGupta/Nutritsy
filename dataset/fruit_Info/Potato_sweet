Sweet Potatoes


Cultivation
Sweet potato plants favor tropical, warm, and humid climates with full sun. They are hardy plants that are adaptable and can be grown in containers, on trellises, or in gardens. Sweet potatoes are grown from slips, which are developed small roots that are sliced off tubers and planted in loamy, well-drained soil mixed with organic compost. They should be watered weekly, mulched to help conserve moisture, and weeded every couple of weeks to protect the growing tubers. Sweet potatoes are typically planted a month after the last frost and mature three to five months after planting. After harvesting, Sweet potatoes need to undergo a curing process in a warm place with high air-circulation for approximately ten days to become sweet and flavorful.
