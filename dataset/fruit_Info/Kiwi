Kiwi


About the size of an egg, kiwifruit is wrapped in a russet-brown thin skin with short rather stiff hairs. The kaleidoscope-like almost glistening emerald green firm pulp is dotted with a large amount of dark nearly black tiny edible seeds that create this fruit's characteristic interior starburst pattern. Sometimes the flesh may be yellow, brownish or off-white. 

Sweet tart with a slightly acidic edge, this decorative fruit's succulent flavor is mainly sweet.

Kiwifruit is available from California during the winter months. New Zealand kiwifruit is available in spring and supplies arrive from Chile during the summer months.

According to the California Kiwifruit Commission, kiwi fruit were the fastest-growing fruit in sales and distribution from 1987 to 1995.

Nutritional Value
Kiwifruit is rich in vitamin C, having ten times more than the equal weight of a lemon. Two fruits have almost twice the vitamin C of an orange and more potassium than a comparable serving of bananas.  High in fiber, it also offers vitamin A, Vitamin E, calcium and iron. Credit goes to all those little black seeds, as they act much like grains, providing lots of nutrition.

Applications
Puree; enhance juices and beverages. Even though the skin is edible, the fruit is usually peeled. Slice for garnish. Containing a meat-tenderizing enzyme, place sliced peels with some flesh attached directly on meat; marinate thirty minutes for each inch of the meat's thickness. To make a kiwifruit salsa, blend four peeled kiwis, one teaspoon minced jalape√±o pepper, one tablespoon orange juice, one tablespoon chopped fresh mint and a pinch of salt. Serve with grilled swordfish, grilled poultry and roast pork. Bananas, berries, mangoes, strawberries, raspberries and oranges are especially partial to kiwifruit. To store, refrigerate ripe fruit up to ten days. Refrigerated unripe fruit lasts up to one month.
