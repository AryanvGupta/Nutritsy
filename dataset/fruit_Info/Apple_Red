Red Apple


Red Prince apples resemble both of their parents. Their sweet juiciness is reminiscent of the Golden Delicious, while their crispness comes from the Jonathan. They are generally deep red in color, very large (with a circumference up to 13 inches), and have an oblate shape. 

The Red Prince tastes best after being aged in cellars for a few months after harvest, which brings out a richer flavor that is both tangy and sweet.

Red Prince apples are available in the fall through the late winter months.

The Red Prince apple, a fairly new variety of Malus domestica, is most likely a cross between the Golden Delicious and Jonathan. It is considered a premium apple that is just becoming known in North America.

Nutritional Value
The deep red color of the Red Prince indicates the presence of antioxidants in the skin, which promote healthy cells and may help prevent cancer. Red Princes also include Vitamin C, dietary fiber, and pectin, which helps lower LDL cholesterol levels.

Applications
Versatility is key with the Red Prince. They are good for fresh eating, as well as cooking, baking, and juicing. Add them to salads, soups, sauces, or baked goods. Red Princes store well, particularly when kept in the refrigerator.
