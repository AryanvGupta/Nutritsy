Cucumbers


Cultivation
Cucumbers are tropical fruits that grow in warm weather with full sun. There are two different types of cucumber plants including vining cucumbers and bush cucumbers. Both types require frequent watering and moist, well-draining, fertile soil. Cucumbers can grow in any amount of space, and the vining cucumber should be trellised or fenced to provide support for the climbing vines. Mulch should be laid at the base of the plant to help hold in moisture, warmth, and to protect from insects and disease. The mulch can be made out of chopped leaves, pine straw, or other organic materials. Cucumber seedlings should be planted a couple of weeks after the final frost in the early spring and will be ready for harvest in the summer and fall. Mature fruits should be cut off immediately as they can become bitter if left on the vine and can stunt the growth of other fruits.

Flavor
Cucumbers are cool, crunchy, and aqueous with a mild, crisp, and light taste.

Nutrition
Cucumbers are a good source of vitamin C, potassium, and fiber. They also contain vitamin K, calcium, beta-carotene, and phytonutrients such as flavonoids and lignans, which are antioxidants that help boost immunity and have anti-inflammatory benefits.

Storage
Cucumbers will keep up to ten days when stored whole in the refrigerator. They should be kept in plastic wrap or in a plastic ziplock bag to help retain moisture, especially when sliced.
