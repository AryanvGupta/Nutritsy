Potatoes


Cultivation
Potatoes are grown in cool climates, planted in rows, and thrive in well-drained soil mixed with organic compost. Once the seed has sprouted, the base should be surrounded in dirt and made into a small hill. Hilling prevents the growing tubers from coming in contact with the sun and turning green and bitter. Mulch also helps control this in addition to keeping the soil moist and weeds from forming. Potato seeds are planted in the early spring and are harvested in the late fall, but many potato varieties are now grown all over the world making them available year-round. Once harvested, potatoes are treated for two weeks to allow their skin to cure which contributes to longer storage life.

Flavor
Potatoes have an earthy flavor and can be starchy, fluffy, and low in moisture, or depending on the variety, they can be floury, firm, creamy, and moist.

Nutrition
Potatoes are an excellent source of vitamin C, vitamin B6, iron, manganese, potassium, and fiber.

Storage
Potatoes will keep up to two weeks when stored at room temperature and up to three months when stored in a well-ventilated container in a cool, dry, and dark place. They should not be refrigerated as the harsh cold environment will change potatoes making them unappealing sweet and easily browned.
