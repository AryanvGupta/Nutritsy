Apricots


Cultivation
Apricots are the fruits of a small deciduous tree that grows in warm climates with periods of chilling. Apricots are extremely sensitive to weather conditions as they require a period of dormancy in cool weather, but they also like to bloom early in the season and cannot tolerate spring frosts. 
They grow best in warm, dry areas and in well-draining, deep soil that is mixed with organic materials. Apricots can be planted from seed in the spring or grafted and budded onto other fruit trees. They need to be frequently watered in the first growing years to help establish roots, but once established, watering is kept to a minimum. It takes approximately five years for new trees to start bearing fruit and fruits are harvested in the late spring through early summer.

Flavor
Apricots are firm and dense with sweet and tart flavors.

Nutrition
Apricots are a good source of vitamin C, vitamin A, flavonoids, and fiber.

Storage
Apricots will keep up to one week when stored whole at room temperature in a somewhat humid climate. Apricots will continue to ripen when stored at room temperature. 
If the fruit is already ripe and on the brink of spoiling, it can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for a couple of days, but the cold temperatures may alter the flavor and taste.
