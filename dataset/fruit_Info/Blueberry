Blueberry

 
Cultivation
Blueberry bushes thrive in sunny locations with well-drained, acidic soil. They can be grown in raised beds or containers with peat moss, pine needles, or composted leaves to enrich the soil and maintain acidity. Blueberry bushes also benefit from organic mulch to keep the roots cool and to prohibit weeds from growing. They should be watered weekly to keep the shallow root system moist and netted to prevent birds from stealing the berries. Blueberries are planted in the spring, fall, or late winter depending on the variety, and begin to produce fruit three to four years after planting. Blueberries are available year-round with peak season in the early summer to late fall.

Flavor
Blueberries are juicy and tender with a mild, sweet and tangy, acidic bite.

Nutrition
Blueberries are high in fiber and antioxidants such as anthocyanins, phenols, and flavonoids. They are also a good source of vitamin K, vitamin C, and manganese.

Storage
Blueberries will keep up to ten days when stored unwashed in the refrigerator. They should be kept in the middle of the refrigerator to avoid over-chilling and stored in a well-ventilated basket with a paper towel to absorb excess moisture and prevent mold. Blueberries will also keep up to a year when frozen.
