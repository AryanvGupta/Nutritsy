Pomegranates


Pomegranates grow on shrubby trees that average between 5 and 8 meters tall. Ranging in color from deep magenta to bright red, the spherical fruits are roughly the size of an apple and have a thin but tough, leathery skin. The interior of the fruit is filled with seeds, technically called arils. 

The seeds of the Pomegranate are the edible portion. Each seed is enclosed in a translucent, bright red pulp that offers a sweet-tart taste with notes of cranberry, rhubarb, red currant and concord grape.

Pomegranates are available in late fall and winter.

Pomegranates are botanically classified as Punica granatum. The name comes from two French words, "pome" and "granate" literally meaning "apple with many seeds". Though usually the standard red variety is all the general public is exposed to, Pomegranates can range in color fruit from pink, white, yellow and purple. In fact, it is estimated that there are some 500 different cultivars of Pomegranate grown world-wide.

Nutritional Value
Pomegranates are rich in vitamins B and C as well as potassium, protein, carbohydrates and fiber.

Applications
Pomegranates seeds may be easily and cleanly removed by breaking apart the fruits in four or five pieces and submerging in a large bowl of water. The edible seeds will sink and the white inedible membrane will float and is easily skimmed away. The seeds may simply be eaten raw as a snack or added into salads, relishes, garnishes or desserts. The juice is highly flavorful on its own, but may be reduced down into pomegranate molasses or fermented into pomegranate vinegar. Complimentary flavors include cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, clove, coconut, lemon, grapefruit, orange, apple, pear, honey, almond, hazelnuts, curry, lamb, chicken and pork.
