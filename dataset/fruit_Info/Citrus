Citrus


Cultivation
Citrus fruits grow on subtropical trees that favor sunny, mild, and cool climates that do not have seasons of frost. They can grow in a number of different soil types, depending on the variety, but do best in well-draining, aerated, and fertile soil. Citrus trees need to be frequently watered to keep the soil moist as moisture stress can suppress growth and fruit production. They also need to be nourished with nitrogen fertilizer multiple times per year to replenish nutrients in the soil. Citrus trees can be planted year-round in mild climates, but the best time to plant is in the spring. They will begin bearing fruit 3-6 years after planting, and spring blossoms produce fruit ready for harvest 7-12 months after flowering.

Flavor
Citrus, depending on the variety, can be aromatic, juicy, sweet, tangy, or acidic.

Nutrition
Citrus is an excellent source of vitamin C and fiber and also contains magnesium, potassium, copper, calcium, and vitamin B6.

Storage
Citrus will keep up to one week when stored at room temperature and up to four weeks when stored in a plastic bag in the refrigerator.
