Persimmons


American persimmons are as their name suggests, native to North America. The small fruits are most often orange but can be golden yellow to red in color. Unripe fruits are hard and contain high levels of tannins and produce a very astringent taste. 

Ripe fruits are one to 2 inches in diameter and are very soft, the sugars fully developed resulting in a sweet flesh.

American persimmons are available in the fall and winter months.

American persimmons are botanically known as Diospyros virginiana, with a hint of their country of origin embedded in the species name. American persimmon trees are semi-wild and are often used as “edible landscaping” for both fruit and appearance as well as an attractor for wildlife, like deer and birds. Commercially, the Asian persimmon varieties are more well-known in the United States though some efforts are being made in Indiana to commercialize the American variety. It is known in the south as simmon, possumwood, and Florida persimmon.

Nutritional Value
American persimmons are high in tannins and low in both protein and fat.

Applications
American persimmons are most often eaten fresh, when ripe or used in recipes for candies, baked goods and beverages. Dried American persimmons can be used in baked goods and have also been fermented with hops and whole grains to make a kind of beer. To store, refrigerate unripe fruit until ready for use. Once ripe, American persimmons are quite perishable.
