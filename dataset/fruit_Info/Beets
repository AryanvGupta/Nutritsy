Beets


Cultivation
Beets are an annual, cool season root that can survive in climates with some frost. They grow best in full or partial sun and in rich, sandy, loamy soil that is mixed with compost and rotted manure. Beet plants can be mulched to keep weeds from growing and need frequent watering to keep the soil moist. They also need to be thinned as one seed can generate multiple plants. Beets are grown from seed and should be planted in the spring, approximately one month before the last frost. They can also be planted again in the fall for a second crop. Beets are ready for harvest 50-70 days after planting.

Flavor
Beets are firm and moist with sweet and earthy flavors.

Nutrition
Beets are an excellent source of vitamin C, folate, manganese, fiber, and potassium. 
They also contain vitamin B6, beta-carotene, and iron.

Storage
Beets will keep up to seven days when stored fresh in the refrigerator. They should be washed and trimmed leaving two centimeters of the tops intact, and the Beet tops should then be stored separately. Beet tops will keep up to three days in a plastic bag in the refrigerator. Beets can also be frozen, pickled, or canned for extended use.
