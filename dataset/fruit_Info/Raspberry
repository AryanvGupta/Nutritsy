Raspberries


Raspberries are an aggregate fruit of individual drupelets that are held together by very fine, nearly invisible hairs. They have a hollow core and are conical with an overall rounded shape. The hollow core is created when the Raspberry is separated from its growing receptacle. 

Their flavor can range from sweet-tart to low acid and jam-like depending on growing region and variety.

Raspberries are available year-round, with peak season in the summer.

Raspberries, botanical name Rubus idaeus, are a bramble fruit of a perennial shrub within the family, Rosaceae (the rose family). There are two types of Raspberry plants: summer-bearers, which produce one crop per season and ever-bearers, which produce two crops, one in summer and one in fall. Traditionally thought of as the usual red, different Raspberry varieties can range in color from golden to purple and even black.

Nutritional Value
Raspberries are a good source of vitamins B and C, folic acid, copper, iron, antioxidants, and ellagic acid, a phenolic compound known to prevent cancer. They also have a high proportion of dietary fiber, comprising of around 20% of the berryâ€™s total weight.

Applications
Raspberries are most often utilized in sweet applications, such as jams, jellies, desserts and other baked goods. Their tart and earthy flavor also works well in salads featuring blue cheese and spicy greens as well as other savory recipes. Combine the berries with ginger, sesame and a touch of soy for a glaze over salmon, duck or chicken. Barbecue sauces, marinades and homemade ketchup all benefit from a touch of Raspberry. Other complimentary pairings include cocoa, exotic fruits, raisins, creamy and bloomy rind cheeses, honey, peaches, coconut, cinnamon, blueberries, cardamom and lavender.
