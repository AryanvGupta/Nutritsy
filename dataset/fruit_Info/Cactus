Cactus


Cultivation
Nopal cacti thrive in dry and warm climates with full sun. Cacti can be grown from seed, but due to slow growth, planting a nopal, or pad, from an existing Cactus will help speed up the growing process. Cacti require a blend of coarse sand or pumice and garden soil that is well-draining. Once the pad is planted, it needs to be undisturbed for a month to establish roots. During this time, the pad does not need to be watered and has enough water to sustain itself in the process. Depending on the variety, it will take a few days or a few weeks for the roots to establish. Once established, the Cactus only needs to be watered when the soil is completely dry. More pads will grow approximately one year after planting, and established Cacti pads can be harvested 4-6 times a year. Pads should be harvested in the mid-morning to mid-afternoon to avoid bitterness.

Flavor
Nopal cactus pads are firm, aqueous, and crunchy with a green and slightly tart flavor.

Nutrition
Nopal cactus pads are an excellent source of fiber, vitamin A, and vitamin C. They also contain some calcium, magnesium, potassium, and manganese.

Storage
Nopal cactus pads will keep up to one week when wrapped in plastic and stored in the refrigerator. They can also be pickled, canned, or frozen for extended long-term use.
