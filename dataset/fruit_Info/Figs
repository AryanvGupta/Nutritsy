Figs


Cultivation
Figs are the fruits of a small tree or tall deciduous shrub with tropical and subtropical origins and thrive in climates with hot, humid, and long summers. Figs need full sun and well-draining, sandy loam soil mixed with organic material and bark chips. They also have a shallow root system and need to be watered consistently to maintain soil moisture but should be watered less during the flower and fruit periods. Mulching around the tree will help retain moisture and keep weeds from growing. Fig trees should be fertilized annually to maintain nutrients within the soil. Figs can be planted in the spring from cuttings and depending on the variety, may be self-pollinating. The fruits will be ready for harvest in the fall, and some varieties may produce multiple crops in a year.

Flavor
Figs are tender, slightly crunchy, syrupy, and sweet with a nutty hazelnut flavor mixed with notes of berries.
