Eggplants


Cultivation
Eggplants thrive in warm weather and can grow in containers, raised beds, or gardens with plenty of space to expand. Eggplants like to grow vertically and should be staked to provide support for the upright growth. Well-drained, fertile soil provides optimum growing conditions and they also need fertilizer and mulch to help keep the soil moist, warm, and nutrient dense. Many insects can harm Eggplants, so covering the plant and weekly inspecting the underside of leaves can help protect against damage. Eggplants are grown from seed indoors for a month before transplanting outside to ensure the sprouts can survive. Eggplants are harvested in the summer, and mature fruits should be picked immediately as they can stunt the further growth of other fruits on the same branch.

Flavor
Eggplants are mild, tender, and may be slightly bitter depending on the variety and the number of seeds inside the fruit.

Nutrition
Eggplants are an excellent source of fiber, vitamin C, potassium, and antioxidants.

Storage
Eggplants will keep up to three days when stored in a cool, dark, and dry place. Eggplants should not be stored in a sealed container or the refrigerator as they will spoil quicker, but they can be placed in a well-ventilated basket or bowl at room temperature.
