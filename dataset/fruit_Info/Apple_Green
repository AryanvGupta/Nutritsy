Green Apple


Green apples, as their name suggests, have an even, bright green skin, sometimes greenish-yellow. Fruits with a red blush may have been grown in a cooler climate. The skin is tough with grey or white lenticels. Green apples are medium in size (approximately 2 ¼ inches across) and round-conical in shape, with some ribbing.  

The Green apple’s white flesh is hard, crispy, and juicy. The flavor of Green apples is extremely acidic, sometimes to the point of not having other taste, but generally refreshing. Green apples grown in South Africa can be sweeter than those fruits grown in other parts of the world.

Green apples are available year round; those from South Africa are available summer through fall.

Green apples are the generic name in Singapore for Granny Smith apples, the classic variety of Malus botanica available around the world. Originally from Australia, Granny Smiths are now grown in places such as South Africa and shipped to countries such as Singapore, other African countries, and countries in the European Union.

Nutritional Value
Apples are high in vitamin C and dietary fiber, and are also a good source of potassium. The antioxidants and flavonoids in apples help prevent respiratory disease, while the fiber helps with digestion and reduces the risk of developing diabetes. Apples are also low in fat with no cholesterol.

Applications
Green apples are usually thought of as a dessert variety for fresh eating, but they can be a dual-purpose apple, good for baking or cooking in recipes that require an acidic apple variety. 
They can be used in sweet recipes such as cakes and pies or savory recipes such as stews, paired with pork or chicken. Green apples store well, one of the reasons they have become such an important fruit for exporting in South Africa, Australia, and other countries where they are grown.
