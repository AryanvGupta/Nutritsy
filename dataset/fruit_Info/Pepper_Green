Green peppers


A member of the Nightshade family, the Green Bell pepper is closed related to the Wax pepper. Easily recognized for its bell-like shape, the Green Bell pepper has a thick outer skin and hollow center. 

Green Bell peppers offer a crisp texture, with a green flavor that has lingering mild acidic notes.

Green Bell peppers are available year-round.

Green bell peppers, botanically classified as Capsicum annuum, are the young, edible fruits of the perennial or annual plant that is a member of the Solanaceae family. Green bell pepper plants can grow up to one meter in height and lack capsaicin, which is the element that causes the tongue to taste spice or heat. Also known as Capsicum and Paprika in Europe, Green bell peppers are harvested prematurely when they are still young, approximately seventy days after planting. These peppers are favored by chefs and home cooks for their mildly bitter flavor and juicy, crunchy texture.
