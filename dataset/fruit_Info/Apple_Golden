Golden Apple


Golden Fujis are notable for their glowing yellow color, produced by preventing sunlight from reaching each fruit. In all other respects, Golden Fujis are very similar to regular, red Fujis. They are round in shape and a little more than 2 inches in diameter. The skin is thin, while the flesh inside is crisp, firm, and juicy. Because Golden Fujis generally stay on the tree for a month longer than red Fujis, they have an even more pronounced honeyed, sweet taste.

Golden Fuji apples are available in the late fall through winter.

Golden Fuji apples (Malus domestica) are the same variety as regular red Fuji apples, but have been covered in bags while growing so that the skin never develops the red coloring in the sun. The Golden Fuji is also called the Creamy Fuji or Butter Fuji. They are produced primarily in China.

Nutritional Value
Apples are full of beneficial nutrients, particularly fiber. Most of the nutrients in apples are found in and directly under the skin. All together, the nutrients in apples are anti-inflammatory, keep the digestive system and heart healthy, lower cholesterol, and help prevent cancer and chronic diseases such as diabetes. One medium apple contains about 95 calories, one gram of protein, and no fat.

Applications
Golden Fujis are best for eating fresh out of hand. Enjoy the unique color of the skin by slicing into green salads with walnuts or almonds, make into fruit salads with cranberries, pears, or citrus, or simply make a snack by pairing with cheese such as cheddar. Fujis will keep for up to three months in cool, dry storage.
