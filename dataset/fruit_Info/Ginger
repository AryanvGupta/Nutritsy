Ginger


Cultivation
Ginger is an herbaceous, tropical, perennial crop that thrives in warm and humid climates. Ginger can grow in a variety of soils including clay and sandy, loamy soils, but it does best in friable loamy soil that is well-draining and rich in organic materials. It also needs partial shade and complements other plants by growing in the shade that larger plants may produce. Ginger requires consistent amounts of water to keep the soil moist. Mulching with green leaves or manure will help maintain moisture and regulate soil temperature protecting it from the sun. Ginger is typically planted in the late spring and will be ready for harvest approximately 8-10 months after planting.

Flavor
Ginger is fibrous, aromatic, pungent, peppery, and slightly spicy.

Nutrition
Ginger is an excellent source of vitamin C, potassium, and fiber, and also contains magnesium, vitamin B6, zinc, and phosphorus.

Storage
Ginger will keep up to one month when stored in a plastic bag with the air pushed out in the crisper drawer of the refrigerator.
