Coconuts


Cultivation
Coconuts are the fruits of a tropical palm tree that grows best in sunny and warm climates. There are two cultivars of Coconut palms, the Dwarf palm, and the Tall palm. Coconut palms are grown in many different elevations and soil types and are only sensitive to cold temperatures. They prefer well-draining, moist soil that has sand or vermiculite mixed with organic materials and requires fertilizer every two months that contains high amounts of phosphorus, boron, and magnesium. Coconut palms are planted both from seed and 9-12-month-old seedlings. In tropical climates, they can be grown year-round, but the best time to plant is in late spring and early summer. Coconut palms will begin to bear fruit 5-7 years after planting and the fruit matures 7-12 months after the spathe opens.

Flavor
Coconuts are firm and crunchy with a sweet and mild nutty flavor.

Nutrition
Coconuts are an excellent source of potassium and also contain calcium, fiber, magnesium, iron, and saturated fat.

Storage
Fresh, whole Coconuts will keep up to one week at room temperature and up to three weeks in the refrigerator. Coconut meat will keep up to four days when stored wrapped in plastic in the refrigerator. It can also be kept up to six months when stored in a sealed container in the freezer.
