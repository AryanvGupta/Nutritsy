Cherries


Cultivation
Cherries are stone fruits, and there are two common species cultivated commercially and in home gardens, Sour cherries and Sweet cherries. Sour cherry trees are self-fertile and thrive in climates that have a frost season as they require at least one thousand chill hours below 45 degrees to flourish. Sweet cherry trees thrive in dry and mild climates and require partner varieties to be grown alongside to pollinate. Both Sweet and Sour cherries require full sun and deep, well-draining soil with good air circulation. They also need to be watered consistently to ensure the soil stays moist. Caution should be taken to resist over-watering as the fruits can absorb too much water causing them to burst. Mulching with organic materials will help regulate the moisture in the soil. Cherry trees should also be covered with netting to prevent birds from stealing the fruit. Cherries can be planted from rootstock in the early spring and late fall depending on the variety and will begin bearing fruit after four years.

Flavor
Cherries, depending on the variety, can be firm or soft-fleshed with a juicy, succulent interior. Sour cherries have a blend of tart and slightly sweet flavors. Sweet cherries can range from subtly sweet to very sweet.

Nutrition
Cherries contain iron, vitamin A, vitamin C, and calcium. They are also an excellent source of anthocyanins, which are potent antioxidants that can help reduce symptoms of inflammation in the body.

Storage
Cherries will keep up to ten days when stored unwashed in a plastic bag in the refrigerator. Cherries can also be frozen for up to one year.
