Bananas 


Cultivation
Bananas grow on a perennial plant that thrives in a tropical, warm, and humid climate. Banana plants are classified as an herb and require sun and frequent watering. They have a high nutrient intake and grow best in rich, dark, and loamy soil with good air circulation. The soil also needs to be well-draining as Bananas are typically planted in climates that receive a monsoon season. For optimum growth, Banana plants can be protected from pests, birds, and wind by being covered with a polyethylene bag. This bag also helps create a stable, humid temperature around the plant. Bananas are grown by planting suckers and are cultivated year-round. Fruits are ready for harvest 11-12 months after planting and should be picked while still green.
