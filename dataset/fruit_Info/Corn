Corn


Cultivation
Corn is an annual plant that thrives in longer growing seasons in a warm, sunny climate. It needs full sun and loose, fertile, and well-draining loamy soil that is mixed with aged manure or compost. Corn is wind pollinated, so the plants should be planted in short rows and a block shape rather than long narrow rows. Plants should also be thinned to give 20-30 centimeters of space to create room for growth. Corn needs to be frequently watered as it has a shallow root system and the plant grows rapidly in heat depleting moisture in the soil. Corn should be planted two weeks after the last spring frost and will take 60-100 days, depending on the variety, to mature for harvest.

Flavor
Corn is crunchy, succulent, and sweet.

Nutrition
Corn is an excellent source of vitamin A and also contains vitamin C, potassium, fiber, and magnesium.

Storage
Corn will keep up to three days when stored with the husks on in the refrigerator. If the husks are removed, Corn should be wrapped in plastic when refrigerated. Corn can also be frozen where it will keep up to eight months.
