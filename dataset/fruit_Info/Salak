Salak 


Salak grow in clusters at the base of the Rakum palm, a spine-covered palm that grows in small clumps averaging 3 to 4 meters high. Technically classified as a drupe, the fruits are 2 to 3 centimeters long and ovate with an elongated tapering tip. Their scaly exterior is brownish-orange and slightly rough to the touch. It easily peels away revealing 2 to 3 lobes of juicy white flesh that house hard, brown inedible seeds. 

While other Snake fruit may by crunchy and mild, this variety of Salak is much juicier, softer and bursting with flavors of pineapple, peach and pear.

Salak is available year-round in Southeast Asia.

Salak, botanically classified as Salacca zalacca, is a member of the Arecaceae, or palm family. Also known as Ridan, Rakum palm fruit, and Luk rakam in Thai, there are at least thirty known varieties of the Salacca palm in Southeast Asia, each producing similarly shaped Salak fruits that are easily confused and often referred to as a whole, Snake fruit. The fruits are named for to their scaly, snake-like exterior and are known for their juicy flesh and tropical flavors.

Nutritional Value
Salak has high levels of potassium, thiamine, iron, calcium and vitamin C. It also has anti-diarrheal properties and if too much of the fruit is consumed it can result in constipation.

Applications
The coarse scaly skin of the Salak easily comes away by breaking of the fruitâ€™s tip to expose the creamy flesh inside. Each lobe within is covered in a white film, similar to that on the outside of a hardboiled egg. Be sure to remove the layer of film before eating. Most Salak is eaten fresh, out-of-hand as a snack and commonly sold by street vedors. Their sweet flavor compliments pies or jams and they can be candied or made into syrup. One variety of Snake fruit, Salak gula pasir is fermented into a wine.
