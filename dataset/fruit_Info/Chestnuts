Chestnuts


Cultivation
Chestnuts grow on a deciduous tree and thrive in humid climates with hot summers. They grow best on gently sloping hillsides where they are protected from the wind and can receive sun and periods of shade. Chestnuts also need deep, well-draining, acidic, loamy soil mixed with organic matter that provides enough space for the roots to develop and spread out. They need to be regularly watered, and multiple cultivars should be planted so pollination can occur. Chestnuts should be planted early in the spring and are harvested in the fall. If they are planted from seed, it will take 25 years for the tree to bear a crop. If it is planted from a grafted plant, it will bear nuts in approximately 8-10 years.

Flavor
Chestnuts are firm and slightly bitter when raw. When cooked, they are spongy, starchy, and soft with an earthy, sweet taste.

Nutrition
Chestnuts contain some fiber, vitamin C, vitamin B6, and manganese.

Storage
Chestnuts will keep up to three weeks when stored unpeeled in a perforated bag in the refrigerator.
